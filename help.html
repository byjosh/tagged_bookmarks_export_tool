        <h1>Help</h1>
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Find places.sqlite from your Firefox browser profile (see <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data</a>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Open it with this tool via File &gt; Open in menu</p></li>
        <li><p>Choose in "Fields" dropdown what fields you want (default is HTML links)</p></li>
        <li><p>Make a choice in the "Export format" dropdown choosing if you want to view the bookmarks & export HTML, save to a CSV file, or export to Google Sheets (see help on configuration re: Google Sheets below).</p></li>
        <li><p>Check checkbox by tag name to show bookmarks with that tag.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use "Append categories for items tagged with 2 tags" checkbox before or after file opening to have shown after single tag checkboxes the checkboxes for those tagged with at least two (e.g. tag A & tag B). Use of window that appears is same as for single tag bookmarks.</p></li></ol>
        <h3>Options in HTML window</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p> click on the links to visit link in default browser</p> </li>
                <li><p>click "Save as HTML file" link to export window contents as HTML</p></li>
                <li><p>copy plain text to clipboard via mouse &amp; keyboard</p></li>
                <li><p>copy all bookmarks as HTML to clipboard via clicking link in window present for that purpose</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Necessary configuration for export to Google Sheets</h2>
        <p>Export to a Google Sheet is possible if you are willing to authorise this as a test app.</p>
        <p>I have decided to use a recommended non-sensitive scope <em>"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"</em> as the scope for the app - restricting it to files in your Google Drive created with the app  (see <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth">https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth</a>). However as this is open-source depending on where you got this from someone could modify it to use a more sensitive scope or to be malicious in some other way. So this is a suitable export mechanism if </p><ul><li>you understand Python enough to examine the program and be reasonably sure it is not malicious</li><li>or you obtained this from <a href="https://github.com/byjosh/tagged_bookmarks_export_tool/">https://github.com/byjosh/tagged_bookmarks_export_tool/</a> directly AND trust me AND trust I have not been hacked</li><li>or you obtained it from someone else you know and trust to both be competent in assessing Python programs and non-malicious</li><li>you are running it in a situation where neither the computer you are running it on nor the account being accessed matters greatly if this was malicious/hacked - e.g. on a laptop with no personal files on it, inside a virtual machine and accessing throw-away account with no personal data in it</li></ul>
        <p>Assuming it is sensible to trust this program with limited access to your Google account 3 things need to be done at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard">https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard</a> under the APIs and Service part </p><ol>
        <li> Under "OAuth consent screen" and add yourself (and anyone you want to use the tool) as a test user</li>
        <li> Under "Enabled APIs &amp; services" search for Google Drive and enable that</li>
        <li> Under "Credentials": create and download OAuth 2.0 Client ID and save this in the same folder as main Python file as <code>credentials.json</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>With that configuration done when you tick the checkbox for a tag with "Export to Google Sheets" as selected export mechanism for first time that should lead to web browser based authentication prompt. After successful configuration and authentication you should have two additional files present in the folder <code>credentials.json</code> and <code>token.json</code>(the former downloaded, second created by successful authentication process)</p>
        <p>As this app is not read only the scope of "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file" is needed and is non-sensitive
        see <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth">https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth</a>. Once configured and you have gone through browser based authentication you will need to create a spreadsheet using the app - as if "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file" is the only scope one cannot access spreadsheets created through web interface of Google Sheets. </p>
        <p>To enable its use without being added as a test user would need the app to be published and possibly to go through verification outlined here https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463073 . </p>
        <h2>Workflow once Export to Google Sheets is configured</h2>
        <h3>Initial window - allows creating or selecting spreadsheet and filtering data.</h3>
        <p>In this window, opening after selecting Export via Google Sheets in main window, one can create spreadsheet (if no existing spreadsheets created with app available to select), select a spreadsheet previously created with the app and filter the data - by ticking a box by any bookmarks one does not want exported.</p>
        <p>Note fields of the form <code>=HYPERLINK('https://example.com','Example.com Home Page')</code> is the necessary format to create a link in Google Sheets that will be visually say 'Example.com Home Page' while linking to the actual URL of 'https://example.com'. This format is important when the URL itself does not say much about the content of the page (a common situation with, for instance,  links to articles in scholarly journals).</p>
        <h3>Final window - creating or selecting spreadsheet and filtering data</h3>
        <p>Once a spreadsheet has been created with the app (so it can be worked with) one can choose or create a sheet within a selected spreadsheet. The ability to create a sheet means that one could export a series of tagged bookmarks with each tag (or tag combo, links tagged with both tag A &amp; tag B) on its own sheet within the same spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Having chosen an existing sheet or created one the data will be exported to that sheet - and the window and previous window both closed.</p>
        <h3>Spreadsheet IDs</h3>
        <p>The spreadsheet ID needed to identify a Google Sheets spreadsheet is shown to the user (to aid telling apart sheets with similar or identical names - to the same end you are shown the date &amp; time each sheet was created).</p>
        <h4>Spreadsheet ID is not editable in app - should it be?</h4>
        <p>If one added the scope <em>"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"</em> to the app
        &amp; made spreadsheet ID box editable (via removing "style=wx.TE_READONLY," in line of code adding the spreadsheet ID box) one could get ID manually to copy &amp; paste in an ID
        by looking at Google Sheets spreadsheet URL (see below) and use this to edit an existing spreadsheet created outside this app. However using only the scope of <em>"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"</em>
        makes app more secure by conforming to principle of least privilege
        (here: only allowing it access to spreadsheets created by app - not all one's spreadsheets).</p>
        <h4>How do I see the spreadsheet ID from a URL</h4>
        <p>For example: if Google Sheets spreadsheet URL was https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ABC123def/edit#gid=0
        then <em>1-ABC123def</em> would be ID (in reality ID would be longer & more random but ID is between the /d/ and the /edit# in URL). The ID can allow you to tell the difference between two spreadsheets that might otherwise have the same names</p>
        <h2>Rationale for this app</h2>
        <p>Firefox browser exports bookmarks as a single HTML file with folders as the organising principle. In Firefox browser you can tag bookmarks in addition to choosing a folder location - and exporting by tag offers more flexibility to export just some of your bookmarks - including those with the same tag but in different folders.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>As an example of utility of using tags and this tool: suppose you bookmark pages about books for 3 reasons: 1) you want to read them yourself, 2) you are research the book as present for another person 3) you used or researched the book as a source for something you wrote such as a thesis. In all cases you could put them in an appropriate folder - but without tags you could not export all three combined. With tags: a common tag of e.g. "book" would allow export of a single list with all bookmarks tagged "book" regardless of folder, using two tags e.g. "book" as the common tag and a specific tag e.g. "to_buy", "for_mom", "thesis" (related to oneself, or books for one's mom, or one's thesis as appropriate) would - using the two tag combo option of this tool - allow you export a list of just the bookmarks labelled, in this example, "book" and "thesis" - showing only those bookmarks you marked as books related to your thesis.</p>
        <h2>Why is this not relevant to other browsers?</h2>
        <p>Besides the issue of Firefox browser specific bookmarks database structure: others (such as Chrome browser or Safari browser) do not seem to use tags (as at spring 2024) and they export as 1 HTML file organised by folder - the same as current default for bookmarks HTML export from Firefox browser. If one only organises one's bookmarks by folder then editing the HTML file exported by your browser is enough to produce a file only of the desired bookmarks. Hence this tool only serves a purpose for tagged bookmarks from Firefox browser.</p>
